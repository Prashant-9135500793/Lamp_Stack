## Your zeroth approach below

Reasoning - If the name of the file is zeroth.c then it has to be run in the compiler. Now, fix the error given by the compiler.int , define ved[] as integer array but it also has characters and integers stored in it which was an array. So by commenting out that part, we get the output as type "man" command in linux, which gives the output below.Also, the c code has a clue "#define clue_of_1 not ROT13 try all".This was a clue for checking for ROT CIPHERS.
The c program gives output-"The answer of this challenge is output of "man" when run on the terminal, copy the exact output"

 Answer - "What manual page do you want?"

## Your first approach below (first.txt)

Reasoning - It is not give the clue to checking ROT13 but it is gave clue for checking other possibilities of ROT CIPHER.When we adding each letter of text in “first.txt” by 8 in a cyclic manner then we see  a logical sentence being created. For example-"a" was replaced with "i", "b" was replaced with "j" and so on..
Likewise "s" was replaced with "a", "t" was replaced with "b","u" was replaced with "c" and so on. I got this idea with the help of ROT CLUE which adds a number to the alphabet and prints that character.

ANSWER-"NOICEE you did crack a rotation encryption on your own. The following is a clue for the next puzzle: CLASS of that INPUT"



## Your second approach below (strings.txt)

Reasoning - the folder whose name was lamp stack in which we use command and find string.txt. After finding string.txt then we open the string.txt and for finding all the location of string use grep command . after finding all the location of the string theni we got location of last string password is fourth.zip
1-8dc2evcCSSc4kUy-"./Downloads/Lamp_Stack_task/question_mark/Lamp_Stack/eleven.txt","./Downloads/Lamp_Stack_task/question_mark/Lamp_Stack/final.txt"
2-TqMuGims7vlJtno-"./Downloads/Lamp_Stack_task/question_mark/Lamp_Stack/final.txt","./Downloads/Lamp_Stack_task/question_mark/Lamp_Stack/ten.txt"
3-ORNwuwGtKDLydge-"./Downloads/Lamp_Stack_task/question_mark/Lamp_Stack/five.txt"
4-g4JoMqFZyat9vd5-"./Downloads/Lamp_Stack_task/question_mark/Lamp_Stack/eight.txt","./Downloads/Lamp_Stack_task/question_mark/Lamp_Stack/final.txt"
5-kPVEQPc6ZN8x2jn-"./Downloads/Lamp_Stack_task/question_mark/Lamp_Stack/seven.txt","./Downloads/Lamp_Stack_task/question_mark/Lamp_Stack/final.txt"
6-DabAWF1UenBD2W-"./Downloads/Lamp_Stack_task/question_mark/Lamp_Stack/three.txt","./Downloads/Lamp_Stack_task/question_mark/Lamp_Stack/five.txt"
7-kw4QLNylm2inErX-"./Downloads/Lamp_Stack_task/question_mark/Lamp_Stack/final.txt","./Downloads/Lamp_Stack_task/question_mark/Lamp_Stack/six.txt"
So on trying the password I got password "eleven.txt" for extracting the fourth.zip file.


ANSWER-Answer to the problem is password for the fourth.zip folder which is "eleven.txt".



## Your third approach below (fourth.zip)

Reasoning - From the password recieved by the previous result we extracted the file in linux command shell by using the command "cd / source" and then by "unzip fourth.zip".By these two commands we were able to get the file named "get_in" which contained different text files amoung which we have to search DevOps{...} string.
Again by using "grep" command to find the text in multiple folder using linux command shell.This string was found in "./Downloads/get_in/4/2_inner/0.txt.
And the string contained "y0ur3_4w350m3_4nd_0ne_5t3p_c1053r" inside it


ANSWER-0ur3_4w350m3_4nd_0ne_5t3p_c1053r
